This dataset contains two subsets: NEG-88-SIMP and NEG-88-NAT. NEG-88-SIMP items come from Fischler et al. (1983). NEG-88-NAT items come from Nieuwland & Kuperberg (2008).

The `NEG-88-SIMP.tsv` and `NEG-88-NAT.tsv` files contain for each item the affirmative and negative version of the context (context_aff, context_neg), and completions that are true with the affirmative context (target_aff) and with the negative context (target_neg).

* For NEG-88-SIMP, determiners (*a*/*an*) are left ambiguous, and need to be selected based on the completion noun (this is done already in `proc_datasets.py`).
